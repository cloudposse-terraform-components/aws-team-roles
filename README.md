This component is responsible for provisioning user and system IAM roles outside the `identity` account. It sets them up
to be assumed from the "team" roles defined in the `identity` account by [the `aws-teams` component](../aws-teams)
and/or the AWS SSO permission sets defined in [the `aws-sso` component](../aws-sso), and/or be directly accessible via
SAML logins.

### Privileges are Granted to Users via IAM Policies

Each role is granted permissions by attaching a list of IAM policies to the IAM role via its `role_policy_arns` list.
You can configure AWS managed policies by entering the ARNs of the policies directly into the list, or you can create a
custom policy as follows:

1. Give the policy a name, e.g. `eks-admin`. We will use `NAME` as a placeholder for the name in the instructions below.
2. Create a file in the `aws-teams` directory with the name `policy-NAME.tf`.
3. In that file, create a policy as follows:

  ```hcl
  data "aws_iam_policy_document" "NAME" {
    # Define the policy here
  }

  resource "aws_iam_policy" "NAME" {
    name   = format("%s-NAME", module.this.id)
    policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.NAME.json

    tags = module.this.tags
  }
  ```

4. Create a file named `additional-policy-map_override.tf` in the `aws-team-roles` directory (if it does not already
  exist). This is a [terraform override file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/override),
  meaning its contents will be merged with the main terraform file, and any locals defined in it will override locals
  defined in other files. Having your code in this separate override file makes it possible for the component to
  provide a placeholder local variable so that it works without customization, while allowing you to customize the
  component and still update it without losing your customizations.
5. In that file, redefine the local variable `overridable_additional_custom_policy_map` map as follows:

  ```hcl
  locals {
    overridable_additional_custom_policy_map = {
      NAME = aws_iam_policy.NAME.arn
    }
  }
  ```

  If you have multiple custom policies, add each one to the map in the form `NAME = aws_iam_policy.NAME.arn`.

6. With that done, you can now attach that policy by adding the name to the `role_policy_arns` list. For example:

  ```yaml
  role_policy_arns:
    - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/ViewOnlyAccess"
    - "NAME"
  ```

## Usage

**Stack Level**: Global

**Deployment**: Must be deployed by _SuperAdmin_ using `atmos` CLI

Here's an example snippet for how to use this component. This specific usage is an example only, and not intended for
production use. You set the defaults in one YAML file, and import that file into each account's Global stack (except for
the `identity` account itself). If desired, you can make account-specific changes by overriding settings, for example

- Disable entire roles in the account by setting `enabled: false`
- Limit who can access the role by setting a different value for `trusted_teams`
- Change the permissions available to that role by overriding the `role_policy_arns` (not recommended, limit access to
  the role or create a different role with the desired set of permissions instead).

Note that when overriding, **maps are deep merged, but lists are replaced**. This means, for example, that your setting
of `trusted_primary_roles` in an override completely replaces the default, it does not add to it, so if you want to
allow an extra "primary" role to have access to the role, you have to include all the default "primary" roles in the
list, too, or they will lose access.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    aws-team-roles:
      backend:
        s3:
          # Override the default Role for accessing the backend, because SuperAdmin is not allowed to assume that role
          role_arn: null
      vars:
        enabled: true
        roles:
          # `template` serves as the default configuration for other roles via the YAML anchor.
          # However, `atmos` does not support "import" of YAML anchors, so if you define a new role
          # in another file, you will not be able to reference this anchor.
          template: &user-template # If `enabled: false`, the role will not be created in this account
            enabled: false

            # `max_session_duration` set the maximum session duration (in seconds) for the IAM roles.
            # This setting can have a value from 3600 (1 hour) to 43200 (12 hours).
            # For roles people log into via SAML, a long duration is convenient to prevent them
            # from having to frequently re-authenticate.
            # For roles assumed from some other role, the setting is practically irrelevant, because
            # the AssumeRole API limits the duration to 1 hour in any case.

| <a name="input_label_order"></a> [label\_order](#input\_label\_order) | The order in which the labels (ID elements) appear in the `id`.<br/>Defaults to ["namespace", "environment", "stage", "name", "attributes"].<br/>You can omit any of the 6 labels ("tenant" is the 6th), but at least one must be present. | `list(string)` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_label_value_case"></a> [label\_value\_case](#input\_label\_value\_case) | Controls the letter case of ID elements (labels) as included in `id`,<br/>set as tag values, and output by this module individually.<br/>Does not affect values of tags passed in via the `tags` input.<br/>Possible values: `lower`, `title`, `upper` and `none` (no transformation).<br/>Set this to `title` and set `delimiter` to `""` to yield Pascal Case IDs.<br/>Default value: `lower`. | `string` | `null` | no |
